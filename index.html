                        <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions.

                        <p>We don't provide "official" solutions for the challenges. This is because there is no single perfect way to complete a challenge. Instead, you're encouraged to review other people's code in the community. You can learn so much by seeing how other people have approached the same challenges and giving them feedback.</p>

                        <p>The desktop-design and mobile-design images show you how the layout should look at large and small screen sizes. The desktop design is 1440px wide, and the mobile design is 375px. However, try building projects to look good on all screen sizes. The desktop-preview image is a preview image used in the README file. You don’t need to reference this while building the project.</p>
